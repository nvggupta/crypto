              HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (Ticker: BITCOIN) is a endgame of
              crypto-assets (0 Tax). BITCOIN incentivizes the creation of novel
              and entertaining meme content. With ownership renounced and
              Liquidity locked, our robust growing community has taken the lead;
              we have successfully completed a full audit, an NFT collection,
              and are exploring partnerships with other tokens in the space, a
              one-of-a -kind website, and one-of-a-kind merchandise and
              ecommerce site in the works based on the legendary meme that
              inspired BITCOIN's creation. Our goal is to create an ecosystem
              for active community members to meet, collaborate, and share our
              rich lore (the archive of our token's storied history) with the
              world.
